# Task 1: Password checker
## Write a simple python console program that validates a password passed by the user as a
command-line argument against a set of rules:
1. The password contains both lowercase and uppercase characters
2. The password contains at least one digit
3. The password contains at least one punctuation character
4. The password is at least 14 characters long
The checker must print relevant error messages into the console in case of any violations.
Otherwise, the script must print “Strong password” into the console if all tests are passed.
